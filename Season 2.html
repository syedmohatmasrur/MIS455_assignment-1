    <div><h2>Episode 1:"The North Remembers"</h2>
        <p>In King's Landing, Tyrion becomes acting Hand of the King, much to Cersei's dismay. At Dragonstone, Stannis proclaims allegiance to the priestess Melisandre's God of Light and claims the Iron Throne, having revealed Joffrey's bastardy. Joffrey orders all of King Robert's bastards slaughtered. One of King Robert's bastards Gendry, along with the disguised Arya, have escaped the city and are being taken to Castle Black. Having won three victories, Robb Stark, who is now proclaimed as the King of the North, offers the Lannisters peace in exchange for the North's independence and Sansa's and Arya's safe return. He sends Theon to gain Balon Greyjoy's support, and Catelyn to seek an alliance with Renly Baratheon, who also claims the crown. Beyond the Wall, the Night's Watch shelters with Craster and his daughters/wives. In Essos, as her people slowly die in the Red Waste, Daenerys dispatches three riders to conduct reconnaissance.</p></div>

    <div><h2>Episode 2:"The Night Lands"</h2>
        <p>Returning to Pyke Island after nine years as the Starks' ward, Theon is reunited with his sister, Yara, and his father, Balon, who despises Theon's acquired Northern ways. Balon plots to win back his crown by force. Cersei rejects Robb's terms, and Tyrion exiles Janos Slynt, head of the Gold Cloaks, to the Night's Watch, and promotes Bronn to Commander of the City Watch. En route to Castle Black, Arya, impersonating a boy, admits her true identity to Gendry. At Craster's Keep, north of the Wall, Samwell Tarly is approached by Gilly, one of Craster's daughters. Gilly fears for her unborn child if it is a boy; Jon Snow resists helping, despite Sam's pleas. In the Red Waste, a horse returns to Daenerys' camp with its rider's severed head in a pouch, a message from her enemies. In Dragonstone, former smuggler Ser Davos Seaworth, who now serves Stannis, recruits the pirate Salladhor Saan and his fleet to Stannis' side. Stannis attempts to sire a male heir with Melisandre, as his wife, Selyse has failed to produce a son. Jon discovers that Craster sacrifices his sons to the White Walkers; Craster catches him spying and knocks Jon unconscious.</p></div>
