    <div><h2>Episode 1:"Two Swords"</h2>
        <p>Tywin oversees the reforging of Ice, House Stark's ancestral Valyrian steel sword, into two new ones. One is for Jaime, who grieves the loss of his sword hand and Cersei's love, and the other is a wedding present for King Joffrey, which Joffrey names Widow's Wail. Prince Oberyn Martell, representing his infirm brother, Prince Doran of Dorne, arrives in King's Landing to attend the royal wedding. He and his paramour, Ellaria Sand, are greeted by Tyrion. Oberyn secretly seeks revenge against the Lannisters and Gregor Clegane for the rape and murder of his sister, Elia, wife of the unfaithful Prince Rhaegar Targaryen. In the North, Styr and the cannibalistic Thenns reinforce Tormund, Ygritte and the other Wildlings. Maester Aemon absolves Jon after he explains his actions while with the Wildlings and reveals that their army of 100,000 plans to attack Castle Black. In the Riverlands, the Hound and Arya head to the Eyrie where the Hound intends to ransom Arya to her Aunt Lysa, Jon Arryn's widow. Along the way, Arya reclaims her sword, Needle, from Polliver, killing him. In Essos, Daenerys marches her army towards Meereen, the last of the three great slave cities; she fears she is losing control over her growing dragons, now horse-sized.<p></div>

    <div><h2>Episode 1:"The Lion and the Rose"</h2>
        <p>Tywin grooms his young grandson Tommen to be the new king and enlists Oberyn and Mace Tyrell as his fellow judges for Tyrion's impending murder trial. Tyrion chooses Jaime as his witness. Littlefinger, who hired Ser Dontos to retrieve Sansa, has him killed, then smuggles her out of King's Landing aboard his ship. In the Riverlands, Arya and the Hound are offered hospitality by a peasant farmer and his daughter, whom the Hound soon robs, angering Arya. To replenish Stannis' depleted forces, Davos wants to request a loan from the Iron Bank of Braavos to hire mercenaries called the "Golden Company". At Castle Black, Sam fears for Gilly's safety and moves her and Little Sam to nearby Mole's Town. Meanwhile, the Wildlings continue to raid northern villages. The Night's Watch learns that the mutineers are camped at Craster's Keep. Jon proposes an attack on them to prevent them leaking Castle Black's defense weaknesses to Mance Rayder's approaching army. Daenerys arrives at Meereen and gives a rousing speech before the gates, offering the city's slaves their freedom.</p></div>
